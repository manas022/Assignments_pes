## Introduction to Web Fundamentals

### Assignment 1:.

```- What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web development?```
> Ans: As we know what is client-server architecture is, so as the client gets the IP address it would directly go to that particular web server but the question is how do it get to that server. What route does it take to get to that server and what are the rules and practices it follows in order to get there?
This is where protocal stack comes in to the frame. It is a set of network protocols and software layers that work together in order to enable communication between the devices over a network. It defines the rules and standard which by following they make the connection more stable and easy-going.
The most common protocal stack used in web developement is TCP and IP.
It consists of 4 different layers each having their specific role to play.
> 1. Application layer: Web browser communicates with the Web server using HTTP request/response which happens on this layer.
> 2. Transport layer: The date is sent over to the server through this layer installed in small packets in order to distribute the load over the server.
> 3. Internet layer: The data is sent over to the web sever via IP which means Internet Protocal.
> 4. Link layer: This is where a physical connections is established.

```- What are the different types of web servers, and how do they differ in terms of functionality and performance?```
> Ans: We know that every website that is deployed online sits on a web server. This web server is always connected to the internet and any web server connected to the internet is given a unique address which will allow the user to get that website. This unique address is made of series of four numbers ranging from 0 and 255.
There are several differnent types of servers:
- Web Server
- Application Server
- Database Server
- Email server
- DNS Server
- FTP Server
- File Server
- Web Proxy Server
- File Server
- DHCP Server
- Cloud Sever
Among which the majorly used servers are Web server and Application Sever
_Web Server is the server which is connected to the internet and which would display your website. Web servers take GET and POST requests from the client where GET request is when web server ask for the information when it doesn't have any information and POST request is when a client holds some information and expects a response back_
**And**
_Application server is slightly different from web server so it would have all the code to display the website and dynamically change the code._

```- What is web hosting, and what are the different types of hosting services available for websites?```
_Ans = Web hosting is a service that allowing hosting web server applications on a computer system for the web browser client to access the electronic content on the internet. It might be a webpage or website.
There are different types of hosting services available:_
- Free Hosting: This is a free non-paid hosting service available for a lot of prominent website to host their application/website for free-of-cost.However their is a lack of customer support in here with a low bandwidth and you have no control over your website.
- Virtual or shared hosting: This is the type of hosting where many website rely on one web server connected to the internet.It is under the owner's name and shared hosting provides the user with 24/7 Technical support with the security benefits and it is easy to access.Only drawback visible is due to it being on a single server with a bunch of different users connected the server may go slow for quite a few while.
- Dedicated hosting: Dedicated hosting is a service best suited for the clients who are bigger in nature and holds a larger traffic which makes it a difficult process but dedicated hosting makes it possible for the larges companies to manager the large traffic.It is quite an expensive choice though as it dedicates a whole big server to one particular company.
- Co-location hosting: This hosting service lets you place your own web server on the behalf of service provide.
```- What is scaling, and why is it important for web applications? How does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?```
_Ans: Scaling is comes handy when working with servers and heavy traffic. Scaling alters the size of the system.In scaling we either expand or compress the system in order to meet the requirements.Scaling operations can be achived either by adding resources to meet the smaller expectations or we can add the systems in order to meet the larger expectations.
There are 2 different types of Scaling with which we can achieve the requirements:_
1. Vertical Scaling: When the load on the server is smaller in contrast with load it can handle then we can work up with Vertical scaling.
**And**
2. Horizontal Scaling: When the load on the website spills out due to heavy traffic coming in then additional systems are installed to distribute the traffic and ease off the load.
```- What is SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and how can web developers optimize their websites for better search engine rankings?```
>Ans: Search Engine Optimization(SEO) is a process of improving the visibility of our webpage on the Search Engine Research Page(SERP) so as to make the company's website more visible and discoverable.(i.e. Mostly make it visible on the first page of search history)
There is rule of thumb which says websites and webpages with higher quality content, more external referral links and more user engagement centric are bound to show up higher on the SERP.
Here are the following ways by which we can optimize our websites for better search rankings:

1. Create logs of pages and each page should however contain a minimum of about 200 visible words of text to maximize relevance with Google.
2. Create a Sitemap, Help, FAQ, About Us, Link to Us, Copyright, Disclaimer, and Privacy Policy pages on mandatory basis.
3. Create a home page link to each and every web page and provide easy navigation through all the pages.
4. Pay attention to your dynamic page URLs. Google can crawl and index dynamic pages as long as you don't have more than 2 parameters in the URL.
5.Check your complete site for broken links. Broken links will reduce your other pages rank as well.
